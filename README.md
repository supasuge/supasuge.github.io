## Update
**Out-of-date**

Posts Planned: 19 and counting. 

- I have been quite busy simply taking care of my mental/physical health! I suppose im a bit too motivated to be successful at times...

- **"Great leaders know when to walk away from power, and have the guts & character to do it."**

### Update \#2
- After returning from defcon I have many awesome writeups and posts to share... I haven't pushed changes to main in nearly two months, so this blog is quite out of date. Stay tuned!!!
